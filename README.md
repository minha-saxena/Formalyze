# Formalyze
Formalyze is a chat application that integrates Firebase for real-time messaging and user authentication, along with an LSTM model for detecting informal messages in professional conversations. It promotes professional communication by analyzing and classifying messages based on their tone and language.

## üß† Overview
Formalyze is an AI-driven chat application built with Firebase for real-time database management and user authentication. It uses an LSTM model to detect informal language in messages, ensuring that communication remains professional and courteous.

## ‚ú® Features

-Real-time Chat: Firebase‚Äôs real-time database enables instant messaging and updates.
-LSTM Model: Detects informal language in chats and encourages professional communication.
-High Accuracy:
  -Accuracy: 96.71%
  -Precision: 97%
  -Recall: 96%
-User Authentication: Uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage user logins and registrations.
-Message Moderation: Flags informal language in messages to maintain professionalism.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
-Backend: Firebase (Real-time Database, Authentication)
-AI/Model: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for language classification
-Libraries/Frameworks: Firebase SDK, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
2. Install the Required Packages
3. Set up Firebase
  -Go to the Firebase Console and create a new Firebase project.
  -Enable Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database in the console.
  -Obtain your Firebase credentials (API key, project ID, etc.) and configure them in your project.
4. Run the Application
5. User Authentication
  Login: Use Firebase Authentication to log in with your email and password.
  Registration: New users can sign up using the registration option, which stores their credentials securely in Firebase.
6. Real-Time Messaging
  Start chatting in real-time once logged in. The system will automatically flag informal language based on the LSTM model, helping maintain professional communication.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

-Expand the LSTM model to detect different types of informal language (e.g., slang, abbreviations).
-Implement additional notification features to alert users of informal language.
-Create a mobile version of the application using React Native.
